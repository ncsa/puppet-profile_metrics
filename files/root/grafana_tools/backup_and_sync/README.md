# Grafana Backup & Sync

## Assumptions
- For backup passwordless SSH is to be enabled beween host source and destination server (just needs to be one-way passwordless)
- For syncing both Grafana instances must use the same backing database type and have it located at the same path if using sqlite3
- For syncinging passwordless SSH is to be enabled between the master server and the server being synced to (one-way only needed)

## Usage

### Restore

### Sync
